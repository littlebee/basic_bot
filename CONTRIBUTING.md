Thank you, in advance, for your pull requests!


## Prereq

Make sure your `python` is Python 3.9 or later:
```sh
python --version
```

Install build and test dependencies:
```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install mypy types:
```sh
python -m mypy --install-types
```


## Building

To build use the build.sh script:
```sh
./build.sh
```

## Installing locally

To install build wheel (also calls ./build.sh)
```sh
./install.sh
```

To install as editable for dev testing without having to reinstall between changes:
```sh
./install-dev.sh
```

## Building and deploying docs

To build the docs from source code:
```sh
./build-docs.py
```
NOTE: the files generated by the above script, are in .gitignore

After running the build-docs.py script, you can verify that the docs look correct by starting the mkdocs server:
```sh
mkdocs serve
```
...and browsing to the url shown in the console (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

After building, and verifying, you can deploy the docs to gh-pages:
```sh
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## Testing

Run the main test.sh script from the project root dir:
```sh
./test.sh
```
...will run all of the tests in test/integration_tests and test/e2e_tests


## TIPS

### DEBUGGING DOCS GENERATION

#### Cheat Sheet

https://yakworks.github.io/docmark/cheat-sheet/

#### Bullet / Numbered list not rendering as list

- need a blank line before the dash or asterisk

### DEBUGGING TESTS

It is easier to start with an empty logs dir.  From the root of your project dir:
```sh
rm -Rf logs/*
```

You can make the test failure output more readable and narrow the tests to run a
single test using `pytest -vv` and `pytest -k` respectively.  For example:
```sh
pytest -vv tests/integration_tests/test_central_hub.py -k test_connect_identify
```

The `-s` argument to `pytest` can be used to see prints to stdout from the test file as it runs instead of only on fail.


You can dump all logs to a screen and quickly look for errors.  It's easier to
read if only running one test. To figure out which service a specific line
was output to, scan up in the logs for identity
```sh
cat logs/*
```
